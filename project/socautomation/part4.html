  <section id="takeaway">
    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
     This part of the project deepened my understanding on how SOAR works and how it helps in easing the workload of an analyst in their day to day tasks. It also let me understand that even if the tool already has the input fields given to you, you will still run in an error and that leads in enhancing troubleshooting skills.
     This part of the project also shows that a tool is just a tool and we can use different tool to have our work get better. Skills like troubleshooting is still the best foundation a person should have.
